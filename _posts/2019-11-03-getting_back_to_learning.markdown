Deciding to venture back into learning can often be a huge process. Sometimes it feels as though it will be easy to just pick up a new craft and run into a different profession at a moments notice. Often you will come out of the gate in a rush and tumble headlong ahead and pick up every thing as it is presented to you without hesitation. This is how I felt when starting this bootcamp, even working a full time job I felt as though this will be terrific and all is going well.

Turns out that life often has a funny way of reminding you of what is most important and you can lose your way quite easily. For me my aging father took precedence of this learning. He fell in a parking lot and fractured three ribs and generally just banged himself up pretty well. As if that wasnt enough he also contracted pnuemonia and ended up in the hospital where he resided for about 2 weeks. Of course this was really concerning, what ended up being worse was him having to go on disability and getting a cut in paychecks. I had to pick up extra hours to help bring the bills around so he would have a place to come home to. 

One thing after another and it starts to feel as if I am so far behind that I am afraid I won't be able to get caught in time. Yet here I am turning in my first blog and just trying to take it one lesson at a time. Hopefully I can get caught back and get back on track to what I am hoping will be a better career and opportunity. I know this isnt exactly a technical blog, but this is what is on my mind right now. If you took the to read this, thank you for allowing me to vent on friendly ears.
